# fit_nlp
An End to End Pipeline for Text Modelling

The purpose of this repository is to implement all the necessary steps required for building a Text Classifier in Python.
All these steps have been explained in the Jupyter Notebook(fit_nlp.ipynb).

The core idea of building a Text Classifier involves:
* Data Analysis
This step involved analyzing the entire data using techniques, cleaning it and transforming it to bring out valuable insights.

* Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering involves creating a representation of input data using which the model can be trained better.
In this repository, I have used Bag of Words Approach to create feature vectors for the input data.

* Model Training and Evaluation
